Explanation:
As it can be observed from the table that as the value of gamma increases the accuracy of the SVM model decreases.
The larger the value of gamma, less is the influence of far points on the classifier. Small value of gamma means even 
the farther points are taken into consideration while training the classifier, which means that classifier has been trained
in a better way.

# FINAL EXAM

The following table is the SVM classifier for gamma values 0.00001, 0.001, 1.0 .
We can observe that for the gamma values 0.00001, model overfirts and produce 91% accuracy on train data but on test data it reduces to 87%, means the model is overfitting training data.
For the value of gamma 0.1, the train-test accuracies are almost same.
For higher gamma, the model is not even able to perform training well.
